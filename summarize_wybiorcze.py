tekst = """Sometimes I consider myself lucky to be the first to show your gear. That's so Innovative or just super excited to play with we did The Empire the future. We did the guitar off the future. And today here is the pedal.  Do we find out whether or not this battle by Chase Bliss audio sounds amazing, but I'm demonstrating some mind-blowing features and may have known you set the bar for other manufacturers who hire but may very well be the first of a totally new generations of title to come.  What is a preamp it's basically this but then brought to the Future you can say but what's does that well? This is a Benson preamp which should be and I quote an extremely and black and the first out clean boost overdrive fuzz pedal so it sounds very cool. So this house is this  And a lot more so let's dive in the basics of this sound is controlled with the sliders. You can see over here. We've got the usual volume travel in its base and the Gang has dialing a good time playing through my son a Telecaster to my hook wizard on a clean British voice setting.  So Desu character buttery sickness and raw Edge and if the game is food becomes an angry boy.  One cool little feature this version adds to the original Benson preamp is the mid controls so we can enable them with this little button below which has mid-off pre and post to know it's turned off because there's no life and we can enable it by just pushing it on. So now it says pre vs. Post.  So basically means this is the amount of myths and is it the frequency of Mitch? So if you wanted more top and a little higher frequency that you can cut them out. I'll bring them back in.  So yesterday I was fooling around with the setting and I found a very nice sound. So I do what I always do I took a picture to send it so I could remember so I guess it sounds familiar, right? Well with this pedal you actually don't have to remember because check this out.  No, the spider-verse presets only that also automatically moving sliders or faders or what you want to call it. So you can store your favorite sounds in 30 Banks and you can instantaneously recall all those sounds with just the press one button. And this is one of the best things I've ever seen in pedals. I love off preset. It's super cool that you've been skipping a sound for 10 minutes and then you can save it and you don't have to take it awkward picture trying to remember to settings. So and especially with this better with a mess if amounts of Sally has to offer it definitely makes a lot of sense and the good thing is that you can instantly see what settings are on so that's why it's such a huge benefit to have these automated faders. So how quickly does that move? Well, it's really instantaneous.  But I'll race you come but I already see the comments popping in about moving parts and that being a liability and breaking so I asked you about what happens if it's breaking my take on it is that we've done tons of testing tons of research where I really wish I wouldn't put this out if I didn't think it was going to hold up on the road. If something catastrophic happens, you can just turn a switch out like if you're on the road with the switch and then it turns the motors off and it just acted still recalls the sounds and everything. Okay, but it just won't make the knobs and do the rest of the tour. The gig think that's one of the reasons why it's taking so long to come out what happens if you like block The Debaters from moving.  Yeah, so what happens is it tells you hey, you something's in the way but it's still loads the preset. I haven't actually board a beer in it, but I assume that would make it stop working. This isn't okay to believe it or not. There are more very surprising features to come but man this is so sweet. Lozier. I met you up from jail is 1 and 1/2 years ago at The NAMM Show in California. There was a prototype already of this paddle. It was a little bit it was working a little bit usually so he might not cool. It is to see the title working flawlessly right now and having it in my hands. Anyway, Joe came to visit me later in Holland and they were developing the blooper Federal and we had a great time and that's why he sent me this. I'm not getting paid. I'm just super excited to be getting the opportunity to check out this note that weed medically unable the mid controls. We can push the mid frequencies giving us a little bit little bit more I guess. So now they make control affects a big frequency range.  Now love it smaller range and now it's very small.  Great and cool.  These buttons also back a diode setting off means it's just a transistor only clipping. So that's the standard on the Benson preamp is what we've been playing so far to clipping is what causes the overdrive to a girl we basically got out the edges of the sine wave giving us the sweet overdrive we're looking for and the other two settings are silicon like tube screamers.  Oreck germanium like the Clone sunflower, for example  Next up in these lines are is the button error which will engage later because now I would love to show you what may be the coolest most slick fun and exciting feature on this very Federal. So have a look at the sliders.  You can control with with Manpower telekinesis built into the expression pedal and you can control whatever slider from whatever position to whatever position you want and save preset to hear you see my foot on the controller and one very obvious thing you can do is just control the game with the expression pedal. So here is it  ECMO volume is slowly decreasing so it doesn't become too loud. So it one more thing you can try to do is it's very easy to put these two buttons now we decide which faded we want to control. So I also want to control the niche right now because  This is the third position.  So that its opposition I want to ask them. It's all up. This is the hill position. Let's have them it's over here. No just exit the menu and right now I can control them. It's volume. So nice King Rhythm sounds  So if you want to push the Mets because you're playing louder and you want to be heard you can download every you can now everything in with this battle. It's just wonder of nature the one thing that's so brilliant is that you can also control.  the Mets  frequencies like this. So what do you think that will happen when I play neck of this any idea?  play  We just created a water bottle with an overdrive preamp because we're controlling the frequency of the Mist soda. Miss are push up right now as you can see what this Fator and the frequency controls what frequencies are pushed up. So if we leave that across the Spectrum, I think it's from something between like a hundred fifty years to all the way to 4 kilohertz in a resume or correctly.  So let's just experiment make it crazy. So again, press the two buttons now we can select the game because you want to control the game as well and maybe also the volume to the doesn't get too loud weed said that the position so let's drive to gang up on the hill at the volume of it down here position volume of it up and game down. Yes tonight. We created a wah pedal where the high frequencies have more game than when is that the low frequencies? Let's see how it sounds I have no idea.  The one thing is very cool as well. I need to switch guitar who quick is with the mid setting you can create a sort of sound like.  Sokol and now if you just want to store if you can just hold this one and your sound is stored across while you can even take out the expression pedal and it's shaved. So all of that is pretty awesome for just stand and it's all me to go through all of also at the expression pedals as well as the presets, but that's still not everything because it's the most epic fuzzes I've ever heard. So your screen sound again.  battle on  fuzz on  Open voice sound right now and a gated sound. Choki.  All the way up to open Sound.  Yes, I mean, yes. So when this for this too heavy for you, there's an internal trimpot, which you can I determine the amount of game with us with that is pretty cool. I miss the price. So if you have any idea how much time went into making this title and how much effort it took to get it to the point where it is today, even then you might still think it's Friday. It's $750 and that is a lot of money in a person you look at this battle at maybe it's more like a pedal platform then just an overdraft at all. It's just hard to compare to any other Federal because it's the first one. I like this. It's  It's just whenever you touch it feels very premium. All the sliders feel so good these buttons feel so amazing The Roots solid wood. I mean, I think I get why it is $750. But if you just like the sound of this bed all the hardcore, you can check out this battle because this one is $250 is to Benson preamp. So, you know, it's I totally get it is not for everyone but some things just cost a lot of money to make to develop and reproduce so yeah, there's options anyway. So anyway, thanks Joel and Chase Bliss and Chris Benson for letting me check out his little one. There has been a fun one to make if you thought this was fun to just click that like button because it gives me some feedback. I love that and share a comment in the comment section and subscribe if you haven't already. Anyway, this is fall and I wish you a lovely day and see you next time with her video.  Let me blow. This went out with some nice sounds.  just
